			<h3>Hi.I'M Ardit Shillova</h3>
				
			


			<h2>About Me</h2>
			
						<p> Hi I'm Ardit Shillova I'm 18 years old I'm from Prishtina.
						I finished elementary and hight school in Prishtina,<br>now I'm studing Cumputer 
						Science in Universum College . I chose this course because i like 
						to learn how to code <br>,how can i develop a WebPage, a Game or anything
						else about programing.
						<br>
						In primary school I was in the school "Mitrush Kuteli" in Matiqan for 9 years, this<br> was the place where I started to learn new things, during these 9 years I participated in sports competitions, knowledge <br>competitions, one of the competitions that is worth mentioning is the competition of Lego Robot where my school took<br> third place. With this race I completed the elementary school adventure by continuing one step higher in high school.
						<br>
						In high school I was in the school "7 Shtatori" in Pristina where for 3 years I studied for trade,
						but during <br>the study I started the greatest interest in programming where at this time I decided to study computer science.<br> In the second year of study during in school testing I took first place for both computer science and geography,<br> but the third year was more difficult because in the world started the epidemic and disables<br> the physical study where we were forced to hold lessons through the virtual world tool<br> and so end my journey in high school continuing at Universum College in a completely different<br> direction from that of high school,in computer science. This was a short autobiography about me. A.SH</p>
